This will be the core of the app, allowing users to ask questions and receive advice about their FPL team.\n*   **FPL Team Integration:** Functionality to link the user's FPL team to the chatbot. This will allow the chatbot to provide personalized advice based on the user's current team, league standings, and upcoming fixtures. (Requires Supabase)\n*   **Dark/Light Mode Toggle:** A toggle in the settings or profile screen to switch between dark and light themes. This will allow users to customize the app's appearance based on their preference.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background (Light Mode): `#F5F5F5` (very light gray)\n    *   Background (Dark Mode): `#121212` (dark gray)\n    *   Text (Light Mode): `#212121` (very dark gray)\n    *   Text (Dark Mode): `#FFFFFF` (white)\n    *   TextSecondary (Light Mode): `#757575` (medium gray)\n    *   TextSecondary (Dark Mode): `#B0B0B0` (light gray)\n    *   Primary: `#03A9F4` (light blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#FFC107` (amber)\n    *   Accent: `#7C4DFF` (deep purple)\n    *   Card (Light Mode): `#FFFFFF` (white)\n    *   Card (Dark Mode): `#1E1E1E` (slightly lighter dark gray)\n    *   Highlight: `#64B5F6` (a lighter blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel or \"Roboto\" for a more distinct look. Ensure readability and consistency across the app.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create a Chatbot Component:** Implement the core chat interface using a `FlatList` or similar component to display messages. Include input field for users to type their questions.\n2.  **Implement Dark/Light Mode:**\n    *   Add a `useColorScheme` hook to detect the system's color scheme.\n    *   Create a context to manage the app's theme, allowing components to access the current theme (dark or light).\n    *   Implement a toggle (e.g., a `Switch` component) in the profile screen to allow users to manually switch between dark and light mode.\n    *   Apply the color palette based on the current theme.\n3.  **(If Supabase is enabled):** Implement FPL Team Integration:\n    *   Create a Supabase table to store user FPL team data.\n    *   Implement authentication to allow users to link their FPL account.\n    *   Fetch and display user's FPL team data within the app.\n4.  **Modify app/(tabs)/profile.tsx:**\n    *   Add a settings section to the profile screen.\n    *   Include the dark/light mode toggle in the settings section.\n5.  **Modify app/\\_layout.tsx:**\n    *   Wrap the app with the theme provider.\n6.  **Modify app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx:**\n    *   Remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-10T13:07:27.088515"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a chatbot app for FPL team management with dark/light mode toggle.

The key changes are:\n\n**What was fixed:**\n\n- Adjusted the indicator width calculation to use 75% of the tab width for better visual balance\n- Improved the centering calculation to ensure the indicator is perfectly positioned under each tab's content (icon + text)\n- The formula now calculates: `(activeIndex * tabWidth) + (tabWidth - indicatorWidth) / 2` which ensures the indicator is centered within each tab's space\n\n**Result:**\n\nThe blue highlight indicator will now be perfectly centered under the \"Chat\" or \"Preview\" tab text and icon, and will smoothly animate between positions when you switch tabs. The indicator maintains proper alignment across different screen sizes."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "6206dbfd46ce930a060cd7f9cd4bd8ccab722ae2", "message": "fix: Center indicator in FloatingTabBar for better visual balance\n", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T14:32:13Z", "files_changed": ["components/FloatingTabBar.tsx"], "update_number": 6, "parent_commit_id": "01beb1f9fad7d21f50cad93a4234660f0555fff8"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-02T14:30:38Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Can you remove the blue bubble "}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will remove the blue bubble.\nBased on the previous conversation, the blue bubble is an indicator of the current tab.
